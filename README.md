# Smart Movie Recommender System

A hybrid movie recommendation engine built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. This application mimics a modern streaming service experience (like Netflix) to provide personalized movie suggestions using three different algorithmic approaches.



##  Features

1.  ** Top Charts (Simple Recommender):**
    - Displays the top-rated movies based on a weighted rating formula (IMDb formula).
    - Perfect for new users with no history.

2.  ** Because You Watched (Content-Based):**
    - Recommend movies similar to a specific movie you like.
    - Uses metadata (Genres, Keywords) to find similarity.

3.  ** For You (Collaborative Filtering):**
    - Personalized recommendations for specific users based on their past ratings.
    - Powered by **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** machine learning model.
    - Achieved an RMSE of **0.87** on the test set.

4.  ** Dynamic UI: **
    - Fetches real-time high-quality movie posters using **TMDB API**.
    - Dark mode "Netflix-style" interface.
